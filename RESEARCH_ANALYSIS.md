## 2. CORE ALGORITHMS

### 2.1 Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm

**Function: `calculateNextDifficulty(profile)`**

**Input**: UserProfile with performance history
**Output**: Next difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)

**Algorithm Steps:**

\`\`\`
1. Calculate Performance Metrics:
   - accuracy = (correct_answers / total_attempts) * 100
   - speed = (questions_per_hour) * 100
   - consistency = 100 - sqrt(variance_of_accuracy_windows)
   - learningVelocity = accuracy_second_half - accuracy_first_half

2. Calculate Multipliers:
   - streakMultiplier = calculateStreakMultiplier()
     * 5+ correct streak: 1.3x (boost difficulty)
     * 3+ losing streak: 0.7x (reduce difficulty)
   
   - timeMultiplier = calculateTimeBasedAdjustment()
     * avg_time > 2x_ideal: 0.8x (too slow, reduce)
     * avg_time < 0.7x_ideal AND accuracy > 80%: 1.2x (fast & correct)
   
   - confidenceMultiplier = calculateConfidenceAdjustment()
     * avg_confidence < 30: 0.75x (low confidence)
     * avg_confidence > 80: 1.2x (high confidence)

3. Calculate Adjusted Score:
   baseScore = 0.4*accuracy + 0.2*speed + 0.25*consistency + 0.15*velocity
   adjustedScore = baseScore * streakMultiplier * timeMultiplier * confidenceMultiplier

4. Difficulty Transition:
   if difficulty == "easy":
     if adjustedScore >= 0.8: return "medium"
   else if difficulty == "medium":
     if adjustedScore >= 0.85: return "hard"
     if adjustedScore < 0.55: return "easy"
   else if difficulty == "hard":
     if adjustedScore < 0.6: return "medium"
   
   return current_difficulty
\`\`\`

**Why This Approach:**
- Weighted metrics capture multidimensional learning
- Multipliers provide responsive feedback to performance patterns
- Thresholds prevent oscillation while allowing progression
- Incorporates psychological factors (confidence, momentum)

### 2.2 Reinforcement Learning Module

**Q-Learning Implementation:**

\`\`\`
State Space:
- difficulty: {easy, medium, hard}
- topicId: string
- performanceLevel: {low (<50%), medium (50-75%), high (>75%)}

Action Space:
- upgrade: increase difficulty
- maintain: keep current difficulty
- downgrade: decrease difficulty
- focusWeak: target weak concepts
- focusStrong: build on strengths

Reward Function:
reward = 0
if isCorrect: reward += 10
else: reward -= 5

accuracyImprovement = current_accuracy - previous_accuracy
reward += accuracyImprovement * 0.5

if timeSpent < ideal_time: reward += 5
else if timeSpent > 2*ideal_time: reward -= 3

if accuracy > 80: reward += 3 (consistency bonus)

Q-Learning Update:
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ*max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]

Where:
- α (learning rate) = 0.1
- γ (discount factor) = 0.9
- ε (exploration rate) = 0.1 * exp(-0.001 * episode_count)
\`\`\`

**PPO Policy Optimization:**

\`\`\`
State Value Calculation:
V(s) = 0.3*accuracy + 0.2*speed + 0.25*consistency + 0.25*confidence

Advantage Calculation:
A(s,a) = R(s,a) - V(s)

PPO Objective:
L_CLIP(θ) = E[min(r_t(θ)*A_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)*A_t)]

Where:
- r_t(θ) = π_θ(a|s) / π_θ_old(a|s)
- ε (clip range) = 0.2 (decays over time)
- Entropy bonus encourages exploration
\`\`\`

### 2.3 Question Selection Algorithm

**Function: `selectNextQuestion(questions, profile, currentTopic)`**

\`\`\`
Priority Order:

1. Spaced Repetition (Due for Review):
   - Find questions where nextReviewDate <= now
   - Sort by concept mastery (prioritize weak concepts)
   - Return highest priority question

2. Targeted Learning (Weak Concepts):
   - Identify concepts with mastery < 70%
   - Find questions testing these concepts
   - Filter by current difficulty and not yet attempted
   - Return random from filtered set

3. Standard Progression:
   - Find questions matching:
     * topic == currentTopic
     * difficulty == currentDifficulty
     * not in progressHistory
   - Return random from available

4. Fallback:
   - Return any question from topic not yet attempted
\`\`\`

**Why This Approach:**
- Spaced repetition prevents forgetting
- Targeted learning addresses weak areas
- Standard progression maintains engagement
- Fallback ensures always available content

### 2.4 Wrong Submission Handler

**Adaptive Feedback System:**

\`\`\`
Attempt 1: Show error message, encourage retry
Attempt 2: Provide hint, suggest reviewing concepts
Attempt 3: Show more detailed hint, offer concept review
Attempt 4: Suggest difficulty downgrade
Attempt 5: Recommend skipping question

Tracking:
- Consecutive wrong attempts per question
- Error patterns and types
- Concept-level error frequency
- Time spent on failed attempts
\`\`\`

### 2.5 Spaced Repetition System

**Interval Scheduling:**

\`\`\`
Base Intervals:
1. 1 hour
2. 3 hours
3. 1 day
4. 3 days
5. 7 days
6. 14 days
7. 30 days

Performance-Based Adjustment:
- accuracy > 90%: multiply interval by 1.5x
- accuracy 70-90%: multiply interval by 1.0x
- accuracy < 70%: multiply interval by 0.5x

Scheduling:
- nextReviewDate = now + adjustedInterval
- Questions due for review are prioritized
- Weak concepts get more frequent reviews
